# Practice Datastructure
A collection of common data structure exercises accompanied with test cases for self study.  

## How to use this repo. 
Each repo contains `src\datastructure` folder which consists of multiple data structure implementation which as of now you'll find to be empty. 
Each data strcuture folder has two files `datastructure.js` and `datastructure.test.js`

`datastructure.js` contains the class Shape along with common methods without implementation. 
You can add you own implementation along with the test cases associated with each file. 
## How to run test
You can run test for each datastructre by running the command `npm run ${path to your datastructure test file}`
## TODO :
- [ ] Add learning notes / reading material for the DS
- [ ] Write stubs for common algorithms. 
- [ ] Verify correctness of all test cases associated with all DS / Algos. 
- [ ] Add a CLI based interface to track progress.
